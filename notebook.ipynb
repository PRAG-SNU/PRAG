To ensure responses are of the highest quality and relevance, and to avoid score inflation, assess each response according to the following criteria:\n",
    "        \n",
    "        **Scoring Metrics**:\n",
    "        1. **Scientific Accuracy and Depth** : Evaluate how accurately the response reflects current scientific understanding and its depth concerning photosynthesis. Score from 1 to 10, where 10 indicates perfect accuracy and depth, and 1 indicates major inaccuracies or superficial information.\n",
    "        2. **Alignment with Research Objectives** : Determine how well the response aligns with specific research objectives within plant physiology and photosynthesis. Score from 1 to 10, with 10 being perfectly aligned and 1 being irrelevant.\n",
    "        3. **Source Clarity and Reliability** : Assess the clarity and accuracy of the source citations used in the response, such as specific studies, data sets, or scientific theories. Rate from 1 to 10, where 10 signifies sources are cited with exceptional clarity and reliability, and 1 where citations are poor or missing.\n",
    "        4. **Professional Engagement** : Evaluate the professional tone of the response and its suitability for academic discussions among experts in photosynthesis. A score of 10 suggests an expert-level dialogue, while 1 suggests a non-professional or irrelevant tone.\n",
    "        5. **Information Fidelity** : Check the fidelity of the information provided by evaluating its accuracy and the absence of fabricated content not supported by source material. Score from 1 to 10, where 10 indicates high fidelity and 1 indicates significant errors or fabrications.\n",
    "        \n",

    "        1. Focus on accuracy, clarity, depth, fidelity, and professional engagement without considering response length.\n",
    "        2. A score above 5 is considered good; a score of 10 indicates a flawless response.\n",
